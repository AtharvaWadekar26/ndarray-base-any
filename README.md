   ```

6. **Test an Array:** Once the application is running, you can input an ndarray. For example, type:

   ```javascript

## 🔍 Understanding Truthy and Falsy Values
In JavaScript, certain values represent "truthy" or "falsy" conditions. Here’s a quick overview:
- **Truthy Values:** Any value that is not `false`, `0`, `""` (empty string), `null`, `undefined`, or `NaN` is considered truthy. For example, `1`, `"text"`, and `[1]` are truthy.
- **Falsy Values:** The values mentioned above are falsy. If your array consists of only falsy values, the application will report false.
